Machine Learning projects based on tutorials from Eduonix.com:

*`DNA_classification`: compares the effectiveness of multiple classification algorithms on the Promoter Gene Sequence dataset.

*`NN_Gridsearch`: builds a three-layer (input-hidden-output) neural net, and conducts a cross-validated grid search to find optimal hyperparameters for learning.

*`PCA_Iris`: applies K-means clustering to the Iris dataset, using the Elbow method to determine optimal cluster quantity, and PCA to compare the informational quality of dimensionally-reduced data.

*`bgg_reviews`: compares regression algorithms on a set of board game reviews.

*`breast_cancer`: Compares K-Neighbors and SVM classification on breast cancer data

*`cc_fraud_outliers`: compares the effectiveness of outlier-detection methods using credit card transactional data.

*`cifar_cnn`: implements the all-CNN model for use with the CIFAR-10 image recognition data set.

*`mnist_kmeans`: uses K-means clustering to analyze the MNIST handwritten digits data set

*`nlp_classification`: builds a very simple SVM classifier to classify movie reviews as positive or negative

*`sms_classification`: compares multiple classification algorithms on SMS data, classifying messages as spam or not spam.  Algorithms are evaluated individually, and as a voting ensemble.  In this project, I implemented a lemmatizing routine instead of a simple Porter stemmer, and the resulting accuracy of the classifiers improved by approximately 2 percentage points.

*`srcnn`: implements the Super Resolution CNN model to demonstrate image reconstruction and enhancement techniques.

*`stock_clustering`:  uses K-Means clustering to analyze stockmarket data.  This project could be expanded by pulling additional data from the sources, and analyzing how the clusters change over time.  This project also required extensive rewriting because the data services referenced in the tutorial have since been deprecated and their apis changed.
